        <p>THE sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the age of religious controversy.</p>
        <p>十六与十七两世纪是宗教争论的时代。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>If you will notice you will find that almost everybody around you is forever “talking economics” and discussing wages and hours of labor and strikes in their relation to the life of the community, for that is the main topic of interest of our own time.</p>
        <p>假使你肯注意，你会听见你的左右几乎人人永远都在谈论经济，讨论工价、工作的时间、罢工与社会的关系，因为这些都是这时代我们最有兴趣的大问题。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The poor little children of the year 1600 or 1650 fared worse. They never heard anything but “religion.” Their heads were filled with “predestination,”“transubstantiation,” “free will,” and a hundred other queer words, expressing obscure points of “the true faith,” whether Catholic or Protestant. According to the desire of their parents they were baptised Catholics or Lutherans or Calvinists or Zwinglians or Anabaptists. They learned their theology from the Augsburg catechism, composed by Luther, or from the “institutes of Christianity,” written by Calvin, or they mumbled the Thirty-Nine Articles of Faith which were printed in the English Book of Common Prayer, and they were told that these alone represented the “True Faith.”</p>
        <p>一六○○年或一六五○年的可怜儿童们的遭遇比我们还要不幸。他们永远听不见别的，只有“宗教”。他们的脑袋里充满了什么“命定”、“变体”、“自由意志”以及其他无数诡奇的名词，表示旧教或新教的“真理”的隐晦的要点。这些儿童都是按他们父母的意思做天主教徒、路德教徒、喀尔文教徒或萨文黎①教徒。各教都有各教的神学，有的读路德所编的《奥格斯堡问答》，有的读喀尔文的《基督教训言》，有的默诵英文的日常《祈祷书》上的三十九信条。各派都以自己的学说代表唯一的“真理”。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>They heard of the wholesale theft of church property perpetrated by King Henry VIII, the much-married monarch of England, who made himself the supreme head of the English church, and assumed the old papal rights of appointing bishops and priests. They had a nightmare whenever some one mentioned the Holy Inquisition, with its dungeons and its many torture chambers, and they were treated to equally horrible stories of how a mob of outraged Dutch Protestants had got hold of a dozen defenceless old priests and hanged them for the sheer pleasure of killing those who professed a different faith. It was unfortunate that the two contending parties were so equally matched. Otherwise the struggle would have come to a quick solution. Now it dragged on for eight generations, and it grew so complicated that I can only tell you the most important details, and must ask you to get the rest from one of the many histories of the Reformation.</p>
        <p>他们听说过英国屡次重婚的亨利第八整批的夺取了教会的财产自立为英国教会最高的领袖，实行自己任命僧正与僧侣的权利。每逢有人谈到神圣法庭，同它的土牢以及许多酷刑场，他们便做噩梦。他们还会听到同样可怕的故事，一群强横的荷兰新教徒如何捉到十二个无抵抗能力的老僧侣，完全以杀死与自己的信仰不同的人为乐的把他们吊死。最不幸的是两个对敌势均力敌。不然，这争执立即解决了。今则牵延了二百多年，发展的非常复杂，我在这里只可以告诉你最重要的节目，其他的你须参考关于宗教改革的专史。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The great reform movement of the Protestants had been followed by a thoroughgoing reform within the bosom of the Church. Those popes who had been merely amateur humanists and dealers in Roman and Greek antiquities, disappeared from the scene and their place was taken by serious men who spent twenty hours a day administering those holy duties which had been placed in their hands.</p>
        <p>继新教徒的改革大运动之后，有教会内部的彻底大改革。只是素人的人文主义者与贩卖罗马、希腊的古董的教皇已经退位了，占据他们位置的是些认真的人，每天工作二十小时，办理他们手中的神圣职务。</p>

        <p>THE INQUISITION（教皇法庭）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The long and rather disgraceful happiness of the monasteries came to an end. Monks and nuns were forced to be up at sunrise, to study the Church Fathers, to tend the sick and console the dying. The Holy Inquisition watched day and night that no dangerous doctrines should be spread by way of the printing press. Here it is customary to mention poor Galileo, who was locked up because he had been a little too indiscreet in explaining the heavens with his funny little telescope and had muttered certain opinions about the behaviour of the planets which were entirely opposed to the official views of the church. But in all fairness to the Pope, the clergy and the Inquisition, it ought to be stated that the Protestants were quite as much the enemies of science and medicine as the Catholics and with equal manifestations of ignorance and intolerance regarded the men who investigated things for themselves as the most dangerous enemies of mankind.</p>
        <p>寺院的不甚名誉的多年的幸福已然告终。和尚与尼姑皆被强迫日出而作，诵读神父的著作，看护病人，慰藉濒死的人。神圣法庭日夜皆在监视由印刷品宣传的危险学说。这里自然要提到可怜的伽利略了。他被监禁，就因为他有点太不检点，居然用他可笑的小千里镜解释天空，还要胡说行星的行动，这完全是违反教会的意见。但是我们为对得起教皇僧侣和教皇法庭起见，我们应该说明新教徒未尝不同加特力教徒一样的仇视科学与医术，对于那些为自己研究学问的人也一样的表示他们的愚昧与不宽容，认他们为人类最危险的仇敌。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>And Calvin, the great French reformer and the tyrant (both political and spiritual) of Geneva, not only assisted the French authorities when they tried to hang Michael Servetus (the Spanish theologian and physician who had become famous as the assistant of Vesalius, the first great anatomist), but when Servetus had managed to escape from his French jail and had fled to Geneva, Calvin threw this brilliant man into prison and after a prolonged trial, allowed him to be burned at the stake on account of his heresies, totally indifferent to his fame as a scientist.</p>
        <p>法兰西的宗教改革大家，日内瓦的暴君（政治上的也是精神上的）加尔文，不但帮助法政府吊死米基尔·塞维土斯②（西班牙的神学家兼医学家，以作第一位解剖学大家樊萨留斯③的助手出名），并且在塞维土斯设法越出法国监狱逃往日内瓦时，喀尔文将这个有名人捉入监狱。经过一个长期审判之后，只为他的宗教的邪说，完全不顾他的科学家的名誉，竟把他烧死在火刑柱上。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>And so it went. We have few reliable statistics upon the subject, but on the whole, the Protestants tired of this game long before the Catholics, and the greater part of honest men and women who were burned and hanged and decapitated on account of their religious beliefs fell as victims of the very energetic but also very drastic church of Rome.</p>
        <p>那时的事情都是如此。关于这问题我们很少有可靠的统计。但在大体上看来，新教徒比旧教徒早已厌烦这种把戏了。因为宗教的信仰而被烧死、吊死、斩首的大多数老实的男女都做了猛进的严刻的罗马教会的牺牲。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>For tolerance (and please remember this when you grow older), is of very recent origin and even the people of our own so-called “modern world”are apt to be tolerant only upon such matters as do not interest them very much. They are tolerant towards a native of Africa, and do not care whether he becomes a Buddhist or a Mohammedan, because neither Buddhism nor Mohammedanism means anything to them. But when they hear that their neighbour who was a Republican and believed in a high protective tariff, has joined the Socialist party and now wants to repeal all tariff laws, their tolerance ceases and they use almost the same words as those employed by a kindly Catholic (or Protestant) of the seventeenth century, who was informed that his best friend whom he had always respected and loved had fallen a victim to the terrible heresies of the Protestant (or Catholic) church.</p>
        <p>宽容（等你长大时，请你记住这个）是最近才产生的。就是我们所谓“现代人”也只容易宽容那些于他们不甚发生兴趣的事情。他们可以宽容非洲的土人，不管他是佛教徒或回教徒，因为佛教与回教全与他们没关系，但是假使他们听到一位相信资本制度的邻居加入了社会党，要求改变劳动的待遇，他们的宽容便消失了；他们的批评也就几乎与十七世纪和善的旧教徒（或新教徒）听到他向来所尊敬的亲爱的好朋友做了邪教的牺牲者所发的批评一样了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>“Heresy” until a very short time ago was regarded as a disease. Nowadays when we see a man neglecting the personal cleanliness of his body and his home and exposing himself and his children to the dangers of typhoid fever or another preventable disease, we send for the board-of-health and the health officer calls upon the police to aid him in removing this person who is a danger to the safety of the entire community. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a heretic, a man or a woman who openly doubted the fundamental principles upon which his Protestant or Catholic religion had been founded, was considered a more terrible menace than a typhoid carrier. Typhoid fever might (very likely would) destroy the body. But heresy, according to them, would positively destroy the immortal soul. It was therefore the duty of all good and logical citizens to warn the police against the enemies of the established order of things and those who failed to do so were as culpable as a modern man who does not telephone to the nearest doctor when he discovers that his fellow-tenants are suffering from cholera or small-pox.</p>
        <p>“异教”直到不久以前还被认作一种疾病。在今日，若是我们看见一个人对于他自己身体与他的家庭不知清洁，致使他与他的子女容易传染伤寒或别种可以预防的病症，我们便去报告卫生局；卫生局的职员便叫警察帮他移开这个妨碍全社会的安全的人。在十六与十七世纪时，人们看一个异教徒，就是公然对他的新教或旧教的根本原则发生怀疑的男子或女子，比一个染着伤寒的病人还要可怕。伤寒症或者（大概一定可以）毁伤人的身体。按他们的见解，异教确能毁伤永生的灵魂。因此，所有良善合理的市民都有义务报告警察，防备危害固有秩序的人。不尽这义务的人，就像现代人发见他同院人得了霍乱或天花，而不打电话去请就近的医生一样的有罪。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>In the years to come you will hear a great deal about preventive medicine. Preventive medicine simply means that our doctors do not wait until their patients are sick, then step forward and cure them. On the contrary, they study the patient and the conditions under which he lives when he (the patient) is perfectly well and they remove every possible cause of illness by cleaning up rubbish, by teaching him what to eat and what to avoid, and by giving him a few simple ideas of personal hygiene. They go even further than that, and these good doctors enter the schools and teach the children how to use tooth-brushes and how to avoid catching colds.</p>
        <p>你们将来可以听到不少关于预防疾病的医术。预防的医术就是医生不是在人得病后医治。他在一个人无病时检查他的身体及他的生活状况，他以扫除尘垢，教给他什么可吃，什么不可吃，告诉他卫生的简单观念来消除他的种种害病的可能原因。比这更进一步的，就是这些好心的医生到学校去教给儿童怎样用牙刷，怎样防感冒。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The sixteenth century which regarded (as I have tried to show you) bodily illness as much less important than sickness which threatened the soul, organised a system of spiritual preventive medicine. As soon as a child was old enough to spell his first words, he was educated in the true (and the “only true”) principles of the Faith. Indirectly this proved to be a good thing for the general progress of the people of Europe. The Protestant lands were soon dotted with schools. They used a great deal of very valuable time to explain the Catechism, but they gave instruction in other things besides theology. They encouraged reading and they were responsible for the great prosperity of the printing trade.</p>
        <p>十六世纪的人以为（我已设法告诉过你）身体的疾病远不如伤害灵魂的疾病重要，所以发明了一种预防灵魂受伤的药剂。一个孩子长到刚会拼字的年龄，便须学习基督教的真理（惟一的真理）。这个办法间接的对于欧洲人一般进步有一个好处。因为不久信奉新教的地方到处都是学校。他们用了不少宝贵时光解释那本《问答》。神学以外，他们还教给儿童许多别的东西。他们奖励读书。印刷业的繁昌也是他们的功劳。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>But the Catholics did not lag behind. They too devoted much time and thought to education. The Church, in this matter, found an invaluable friend and ally in the newly-founded order of the Society of Jesus. The founder of this remarkable organisation was a Spanish soldier who after a life of unholy adventures had been converted and thereupon felt himself bound to serve the church just as many former sinners, who have been shown the errors of their way by the Salvation Army, devote the remaining years of their lives to the task of aiding and consoling those who are less fortunate.</p>
        <p>但是天主教徒倒也不落人后。他们在教育上也费了不少的时间和思想。罗马教会在教育方面由那个新近设立的耶稣会里觅得一个宝贵的朋友与帮助。这个奇怪组织的创造人是一个西班牙的军人。他少年荒唐，后来改邪归正，便觉自己应该为教会尽职，正像许多有过罪孽的犯人，听了救世军的指导，知道自己的过失，而把他的余年致力于救济与安慰比他们更不幸的人的事业一样。</p>

        <p>The name of this Spaniard was Ignatius de Loyola. He was born in the year before the discovery of America. He had been wounded and lamed for life and while he was in the hospital he had seen a vision of the Holy Virgin and her Son, who bade him give up the wickedness of his former life. He decided to go to the Holy Land and finish the task of the Crusades. But a visit to Jerusalem had shown him the impossibility of the task and he returned west to help in the warfare upon the heresies of the Lutherans.</p>
        <p>这个西班牙人名叫易格内细阿特·罗耀拉④。他在发见美洲的前一年生的。他因受伤，做了终身的跛子。他在病院里，看见圣母与她儿子的圣灵吩咐他放弃他从前的罪恶生活，他便决心要到圣地去完成十字军未竟的事业。但他到了耶路撒冷，才知道这事的不可能，便回到西方来帮助攻打路德派的异教徒。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>In the year 1534 he was studying in Paris at the Sorbonne. Together with seven other students he founded a fraternity. The eight men promised each other that they would lead holy lives, that they would not strive after riches but after righteousness, and would devote themselves, body and soul, to the service of the Church. A few years later this small fraternity had grown into a regular organisation and was recognised by Pope Paul III as the Society of Jesus.</p>
        <p>一五三四年，他在巴黎的索尔奔⑤大学读书。他同另外七个大学生组织一个同志会。这八个人互相约定，各人皆须过圣洁的生活，不争财富，只求正义，将他们的身体与灵魂全部贡献给教会，为教会服务。几年之后，这个小小的同志会变成一个有规则的组织，教皇保罗第三承认它为耶稣会。</p>

        <p>Loyola had been a military man. He believed in discipline, and absolute obedience to the orders of the superior dignitaries became one of the main causes for the enormous success of the Jesuits. They specialised in education. They gave their teachers a most thorough-going education before they allowed them to talk to a single pupil. They lived with their students and they entered into their games. They watched them with tender care. And as a result they raised a new generation of faithful Catholics who took their religious duties as seriously as the people of the early Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>罗耀拉原先是一个军人。他相信纪律，所以绝对服从高级官员的命令，这是成为耶稣会大成功的主要原因。他们专心致力于教育。先给教员们一种非常彻底的训练，然后才准他们教学生。教员与学生一同起居，一同游戏。他们非常小心注意他们的学生。因此培养出一代新的忠实的加特力教徒。这些教徒对于宗教上的义务同中世纪初年的人看得一样的认真。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The shrewd Jesuits, however, did not waste all their efforts upon the education of the poor. They entered the palaces of the mighty and became the private tutors of future emperors and kings. And what this meant you will see for yourself when I tell you about the Thirty Years War. But before this terrible and final outbreak of religious fanaticism, a great many other things had happened.</p>
        <p>然而这些狡黠的耶稣会信徒并没有将全副精力都费在穷人的教育上。他们到帝王的宫内去当太子的师傅。这个结果如何，在我讲三十年战争的时候，你会知道的。在这个宗教热狂的最后可怕的爆发之前，还发生了许多事故。</p>

        <p>Charles V was dead. Germany and Austria had been left to his brother Ferdinand. All his other possessions, Spain and the Netherlands and the Indies and America had gone to his son Philip. Philip was the son of Charles and a Portuguese princess who had been first cousin to her own husband. The children that are born of such a union are apt to be rather queer. The son of Philip, the unfortunate Don Carlos, (murdered afterwards with his own father’s consent,) was crazy. Philip was not quite crazy, but his zeal for the Church bordered closely upon religious insanity. He believed that Heaven had appointed him as one of the saviours of mankind. Therefore, whosoever was obstinate and refused to share his Majesty’s views, proclaimed himself an enemy of the human race and must be exterminated lest his example corrupt the souls of his pious neighbours.</p>
        <p>这时查尔斯第五业已去世。日耳曼与奥地利传授给他的兄弟腓地南。其他的领土，如西班牙、荷兰、西印度与美洲都归他的儿子腓力。腓力是查尔斯与葡萄牙公主（这两夫妇是表姊妹）的儿子。这样的结合所生的子女往往容易变成很奇怪。腓力⑥的儿子，那位不幸的唐·卡罗斯（得他父亲的许可被杀死的）是疯子。腓力自己虽不完全疯狂，但他对于教会的热心几乎是宗教癫狂。他相信上帝任命他为人类救主之一。因此无论何人，凡是固执己见，不听他的意旨，便是承认自己为人类的仇敌，这人必须被铲除，以防他的榜样带坏他左右的虔诚人的灵魂。</p>

        <p>Spain, of course, was a very rich country. All the gold and silver of the new world flowed into the Castilian and Aragonian treasuries. But Spain suffered from a curious economic disease. Her peasants were hard working men and even harder working women. But the better classes maintained a supreme contempt for any form of labour, outside of employment in the army or navy or the civil service. As for the Moors, who had been very industrious artisans, they had been driven out of the country long before. As a result, Spain, the treasure chest of the world, remained a poor country because all her money had to be sent abroad in exchange for the wheat and the other necessities of life which the Spaniards neglected to raise for themselves.</p>
        <p>西班牙当然是一个非常富有的国家。新世界的所有的金银全都流入开斯台尔与阿拉刚的宝库。但是西班牙患有一种奇怪的经济病。她的农民都是劳作的男子与更劳作的女子。然而较高的阶级，除去当陆海军人或文官之外，对于任何形式的工作都极端的轻视。母罗人倒是很勤苦的职工，但他们早被逐出国境了。结果，那个世界宝库的西班牙只落得是一个赤贫的国家。因为所有它的金钱皆须送往外国去换取西班牙人自己不肯生产的麦子和其他生活上必需的物品。</p>

        <p>Philip, ruler of the most powerful nation of the sixteenth century, depended for his revenue upon the taxes which were gathered in the busy commercial bee-hive of the Netherlands. But these Flemings and Dutchmen were devoted followers of the doctrines of Luther and Calvin and they had cleansed their churches of all images and holy paintings and they had informed the Pope that they no longer regarded him as their shepherd but intended to follow the dictates of their consciences and the commands of their newly translated Bible.</p>
        <p>十六世纪第一强国的治理者腓力的财政，全赖荷兰繁盛的商业中心的税收。但是法兰特人与荷兰人都是路德派与喀尔文派的忠实门徒。他们扫清了教会里所有的偶像与神圣的油画。他们告诉教皇，他们不再认他为他们的牧人，而打算服从他们良心的指使与他们新译的《圣经》的命令。</p>

      </div><div class="section">
        <p>This placed the king in a very difficult position. He could not possibly tolerate the heresies of his Dutch subjects, but he needed their money. If he allowed them to be Protestants and took no measures to save their souls he was deficient in his duty toward God. If he sent the Inquisition to the Netherlands and burned his subjects at the stake, he would lose the greater part of his income.</p>
        <p>国王对此实处于为难的地位。他不能容让荷兰人的异教，但又需要他们的金钱。假使他容让他们去做新教徒，而不设法拯救他们的灵魂，他算对于上帝不尽职；假使他在荷兰设法庭，将他的人民一齐烧死，他又会损失一大半的收入。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Being a man of uncertain will-power he hesitated a long time. He tried kindness and sternness and promises and threats. The Hollanders remained obstinate, and continued to sing psalms and listen to the sermons of their Lutheran and Calvinist preachers. Philip in his despair sent his “man of iron,” the Duke of Alba, to bring these hardened sinners to terms. Alba began by decapitating those leaders who had not wisely left the country before his arrival. In the year 1572 (the same year that the French Protestant leaders were all killed during the terrible night of Saint Bartholomew), he attacked a number of Dutch cities and massacred the inhabitants as an example for the others. The next year he laid siege to the town of Leyden, the manufacturing center of Holland.</p>
        <p>腓力是一个意志薄弱的人，踌躇了许久。各种的态度或宽或严的甜言、威吓，他都试过。但是荷兰人仍然倔强，继续唱他们的赞美诗，听路德与喀尔文的牧师说教。腓力不得已派他的“铁将军”阿尔巴公爵去压服那些顽固的罪人。阿尔巴一到椅兰，开手便把那些没得逃走的领袖一律斩首。一五七二年（法国新教徒的领袖在圣巴多罗买节夜全被杀死也在此年），阿尔巴公爵攻下许多荷兰都市，屠杀全城居民，以儆其他的百姓。第二年他又围攻荷兰的工业中心的莱顿城。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Meanwhile, the seven small provinces of the northern Netherlands had formed a defensive union, the so-called union of Utrecht, and had recognised William of Orange, a German prince who had been the private secretary of the Emperor Charles V, as the leader of their army and as commander of their freebooting sailors, who were known as the Beggars of the Sea. William, to save Leyden, cut the dykes, created a shallow inland sea, and delivered the town with the help of a strangely equipped navy consisting of scows and flat-bottomed barges which were rowed and pushed and pulled through the mud until they reached the city walls.</p>
        <p>正在这时，荷兰北部的七省结下了互卫的同盟，即乌得勒支同盟，公推查尔斯第五的私人秘书德意志的威廉亲王为他们军队的领袖，为他们海盗（寻常称他们为海上乞丐）的司令。威廉因为要救莱顿，遂将堤防切断，造成一个浅的内海，由一些平底船所组成的奇怪的舰队在泥面上摇着、推着、拉着驶到城墙下，救了这城。</p>

      </div><div class="section">
        <p>It was the first time that an army of the invincible Spanish king had suffered such a humiliating defeat. It surprised the world just as the Japanese victory of Mukden, in the Russian-Japanese war, surprised our own generation. The Protestant powers took fresh courage and Philip devised new means for the purpose of conquering his rebellious subjects. He hired a poor half-witted fanatic to go and murder William of Orange. But the sight of their dead leader did not bring the Seven Provinces to their knees. On the contrary it made them furiously angry. In the year 1581, the Estates General(the meeting of the representatives of the Seven Provinces) came together at the Hague and most solemnly abjured their “wicked king Philip” and themselves assumed the burden of sovereignty which thus far had been invested in their “King by the Grace of God.”</p>
        <p>这是天下无敌的西班牙军第一次受如此大的挫折。这事在当时震动了全世界，就像日俄战争时日本人在奉天的胜利震动了我们（美国人）一样。新教的国家得了新的勇气，腓力于是筹划新的方法征服反叛的人民。他买通一个可怜的半疯子去刺死奥伦治的威廉。但这领袖的受刺，不特不能屈服七省的人民，反使他们愈加愤怒。一五八一年在海牙召集的阶级会议（七省代表的会议）非常郑重的弃绝他们的“昏君腓力”，声明向来上帝赐与他们国王的主权，此后全由他们自己担负。</p>

        <p>THE MURDER OF WILLIAM THE SILENT（威廉被刺）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>This is a very important event in the history of the great struggle for political liberty. It was a step which reached much further than the uprising of the nobles which ended with the signing of the Magna Carta. These good burghers said “Between a king and his subjects there is a silent understanding that both sides shall perform certain services and shall recognise certain definite duties. If either party fails to live up to this contract, the other has the right to consider it terminated.” The American subjects of King George III in the year 1776 came to a similar conclusion. But they had three thousand miles of ocean between themselves and their ruler and the Estates General took their decision (which meant a slow death in case of defeat) within hearing of the Spanish guns and although in constant fear of an avenging Spanish fleet.</p>
        <p>这是历史上为政治自由奋斗的一个重要事件。这件事比从前英国的贵族为争《大宪章》发生的暴动更进一步。这些良善的市民说：“国王与人民之间有一种默契：就是两方面都应该尽某种职务，承认某种确定的责任。假使任何方面没有履行这个契约，另一方面便有权利使这契约停止有效。”一七七六年，英王乔治第三的美国百姓也得到同样的决议。但是他们与国王之间隔着三千英里的海程，而这个阶级会议议决的时候（假使败了，就会慢慢的灭亡）还听得见西班牙的炮声，并且还时时害怕西班牙舰队来报复。</p>

        <p>The stories about a mysterious Spanish fleet that was to conquer both Holland and England, when Protestant Queen Elizabeth had succeeded Catholic “Bloody Mary” was an old one. For years the sailors of the waterfront had talked about it. In the eighties of the sixteenth century, the rumour took a definite shape. According to pilots who had been in Lisbon, all the Spanish and Portuguese wharves were building ships. And in the southern Netherlands(in Belgium) the Duke of Parma was collecting a large expeditionary force to be carried from Ostend to London and Amsterdam as soon as the fleet should arrive.</p>
        <p>在新教徒的依利萨伯⑦女王继承旧教徒的马利女王的王位时所传说的神秘的西班牙舰队将要征服荷兰与英格兰乃是一个老故事。海上的水手们谈论这事已有多年了。一七八○年这个谣言渐渐成形。据到过里斯本的水手们说，所有西班牙与葡萄牙的船坞里都在赶造军舰。并且帕尔马公爵在荷兰的南部（比利时）招集一个大的远征队，等到舰队一到，立刻就要从俄斯坦德出发到伦敦与阿姆斯特丹。</p>

        <p>In the year 1586 the Great Armada set sail for the north. But the harbours of the Flemish coast were blockaded by a Dutch fleet and the Channel was guarded by the English, and the Spaniards, accustomed to the quieter seas of the south, did not know how to navigate in this squally and bleak northern climate. What happened to the Armada once it was attacked by ships and by storms I need not tell you. A few ships, by sailing around Ireland, escaped to tell the terrible story of defeat. The others perished and lie at the bottom of the North Sea.</p>
        <p>一五八六年，大舰队便向北方出发。但是法兰特的海岸已被荷兰的舰队封锁，英国的海峡也有英国人把守。向来在南方平静的海里习惯了的西班牙人来到这个风云不测的寒冷天气里不知如何驾驶了。这个大舰队一旦受到英、荷舰队与暴风雨的袭击，结果如何，我就不必讲了。只剩几只零落的船绕过爱尔兰，逃回去报告这次的惨败。其他的船全都沉没到北海底里。</p>

        <p>Turn about is fair play. The British and the Dutch Protestants now carried the war into the territory of the enemy. Before the end of the century, Houtman, with the help of a booklet written by Linschoten (a Hollander who had been in the Portuguese service), had at last discovered the route to the Indies. As a result the great Dutch East India Company was founded and a systematic war upon the Portuguese and Spanish colonies in Asia and Africa was begun in all seriousness.</p>
        <p>情形翻转过来了。英、荷的新教徒现在都到敌人疆土之内去作战。十六世纪之末，赫脱曼根据林肖登⑧（一个在葡萄牙服务的荷兰人）所写的小册子发见了通印度的路。结果那个大的荷兰东印度公司便成立了，而荷兰对于葡萄牙与西班牙在亚非两洲的殖民地有系统的战争便郑重的开始了。</p>

        <p>It was during this early era of colonial conquest that a curious lawsuit was fought out in the Dutch courts. Early in the seventeenth century a Dutch Captain by the name of van Heemskerk, a man who had made himself famous as the head of an expedition which had tried to discover the North Eastern Passage to the Indies and who had spent a winter on the frozen shores of the island of Nova Zembla, had captured a Portuguese ship in the straits of Malacca. You will remember that the Pope had divided the world into two equal shares, one of which had been given to the Spaniards and the other to the Portuguese. The Portuguese quite naturally regarded the water which surrounded their Indian islands as part of their own property and since, for the moment, they were not at war with the United Seven Netherlands, they claimed that the captain of a private Dutch trading company had no right to enter their private domain and steal their ships. And they brought suit. The directors of the Dutch East India Company hired a bright young lawyer, by the name of De Groot or Grotius, to defend their case. He made the astonishing plea that the ocean is free to all comers. Once outside the distance which a cannon ball fired from the land can reach, the sea is or (according to Grotius) ought to be, a free and open highway to all the ships of all nations. It was the first time that this startling doctrine had been publicly pronounced in a court of law. It was opposed by all the other seafaring people. To counteract the effect of Grotius’ famous plea for the “Mare Liberum,” or “Open Sea,” John Selden, the Englishman, wrote his famous treatise upon the “Mare Clausum” or“Closed Sea” which treated of the natural right of a sovereign to regard the seas which surrounded his country as belonging to his territory. I mention this here because the question had not yet been decided and during the last war caused all sorts of difficulties and complications.</p>
        <p>当殖民地征服的初年，荷兰的法庭结束了一件奇怪的讼案。在十七世纪的初叶，一个荷兰的船长名梵黑谟兹刻⑨（这人曾率领探险队，去找通印度的东北路，曾在新地岛冰冻的岸上过冬，因此出了名），在麻六甲海岬捉到一只葡萄牙船。你总还记得教皇曾将世界平分为两半，一半给西班牙人，另一半给葡萄牙人。葡萄牙人自然会把印度群岛周围的海洋认为自己的所有物，又因为当时他们不与联合的七省战争，他们认为一个私立的荷兰贸易公司的船长没有权力偷进他们的领域劫取他们的船只。于是他们到法庭起诉。荷兰东印度公司的董事们请了一位聪明的少年律师名格老秀斯，替他们辩护。这位律师提出一个惊人的抗议，就是海洋对于一切来往的人都是自由的。除去陆地的炮弹可以射击的距离之外，所有的海面都是，或（按格老秀斯的意见）应该是任何国家的一切船只的自由的开放的交通孔道。这是第一次在一个法庭上公然宣布如此惊人的主义。所有其他航海的国民都反对这个主义。英国人约翰·赛尔登为抵抗格老秀斯的著名的“公海”主义的影响，写了一篇关于“私海”主义的著名论文，他说一国的元首以他疆土周围的海洋作为自己的领域是当然的权利。我所以在此提起这问题，是因为这问题至今尚未解决，并且在上次欧战时，曾引起种种的困难与纠纷。</p>

        <p>To return to the warfare between Spaniard and Hollander and Englishman, before twenty years were over the most valuable colonies of the Indies and the Cape of Good Hope and Ceylon and those along the coast of China and even Japan were in Protestant hands. In 1621 a West Indian Company was founded which conquered Brazil and in North America built a fortress called Nieuw Amsterdam at the mouth of the river which Henry Hudson had discovered in the year 1609.</p>
        <p>如今我们再回到前面所讲的西班牙、荷兰与英格兰的战争。不到二十年工夫，印度好望角与锡兰岛最有价值的殖民地以及中国的甚至日本的沿岸各地都落入新教徒手里。一六二一年，一个西印度公司成立了，它征服了巴西，且在亨利·哈德孙于一六○九年在北美所发见的河口设立一个防地，称之为新阿姆斯特丹（即现在的纽约）。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>These new colonies enriched both England and the Dutch Republic to such an extent that they could hire foreign soldiers to do their fighting on land while they devoted themselves to commerce and trade. To them the Protestant revolt meant independence and prosperity. But in many other parts of Europe it meant a succession of horrors compared to which the last war was a mild excursion of kindly Sunday-school boys.</p>
        <p>这些新的殖民地使英格兰与荷兰共和国富裕到有力雇用外国兵替他们在陆地上打仗而他们自己得以专心一志的经营商业。新教徒的革命对于他们乃是独立与繁昌。但在欧洲别的地方，这个革命乃是接连不断的恐怖。上次欧洲大战比起它来不过是个儿戏罢了。</p>

        <p>THE DEATH OF HUDSON（哈德孙之死）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The Thirty Years War which broke out in the year 1618 and which ended with the famous treaty of Westphalia in 1648 was the perfectly natural result of a century of ever increasing religious hatred. It was, as I have said, a terrible war. Everybody fought everybody else and the struggle ended only when all parties had been thoroughly exhausted and could fight no longer.</p>
        <p>起于一六一八年而终于一六四八年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》的三十年战争，是一百年来宗教仇恨永远增长的自然结果。我已经说过这是一场极厉害的战争。人人都互相争战，直到各方面都是精疲力尽无力再战为止。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>In less than a generation it turned many parts of central Europe into a wilderness, where the hungry peasants fought for the carcass of a dead horse with the even hungrier wolf. Five-sixths of all the German towns and villages were destroyed. The Palatinate, in western Germany, was plundered twenty-eight times. And a population of eighteen million people was reduced to four million.</p>
        <p>不到一代的工夫，中欧许多地方尽变成荒野，饥饿的农民与更饥饿的豺狼争夺死马的尸体。德国的六分之五的都会与村落尽被毁灭无遗。德意志西部的巴拉丁前后被劫二十八次之多。一千八百万人民减剩到了四百万。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The hostilities began almost as soon as Ferdinand II of the House of Habsburg had been elected Emperor. He was the product of a most careful Jesuit training and was a most obedient and devout son of the Church. The vow which he had made as a young man, that he would eradicate all sects and all heresies from his domains, Ferdinand kept to the best of his ability. Two days before his election, his chief opponent, Frederick, the Protestant Elector of the Palatinate and a son-in-law of James I of England, had been made King of Bohemia, in direct violation of Ferdinand’s wishes.</p>
        <p>这场战争在哈布斯堡的腓地南二世被举为皇帝的时候，几乎便开始了。腓地南二世是由耶稣会用心教育出来的成绩，是教会的最服从最虔诚的子民。他幼年立誓，要在他领土之内扫除一切教派一切异端，后来他尽力实践他的誓愿。在他被举的两天前，他最大的仇敌腓特立克（这人是巴拉丁的新教徒的选侯，又是英国惹米斯⑩第一的女婿）被举为波希米亚王，大为腓地南所不满。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>At once the Habsburg armies marched into Bohemia. The young king looked in vain for assistance against this formidable enemy. The Dutch Republic was willing to help, but, engaged in a desperate war of its own with the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, it could do little. The Stuarts in England were more interested in strengthening their own absolute power at home than spending money and men upon a forlorn adventure in far away Bohemia. After a struggle of a few months, the Elector of the Palatinate was driven away and his domains were given to the Catholic house of Bavaria. This was the beginning of the great war.</p>
        <p>哈布斯堡的军队于是立即进攻波希米亚。这位年少君主想要抵抗这个可怕的敌人，但无法求外助。荷兰共和国很愿意帮他，但他自己正与哈布斯堡的西班牙军队拼命死战，所能帮助的极有限。英格兰的斯图亚特王室则宁愿在国内巩固自己的绝对势力，不愿耗费金钱与人命到遥远的波希米去冒险。因此，经过几月的战争之后，巴拉丁的选侯被逐出境，他的疆土给了巴威略的旧教徒的王室。这就是这场大战的开始。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Then the Habsburg armies, under Tilly and Wallenstein, fought their way through the Protestant part of Germany until they had reached the shores of the Baltic. A Catholic neighbour meant serious danger to the Protestant king of Denmark. Christian IV tried to defend himself by attacking his enemies before they had become too strong for him. The Danish armies marched into Germany but were defeated. Wallenstein followed up his victory with such energy and violence that Denmark was forced to sue for peace. Only one town of the Baltic then remained in the hands of the Protestants. That was Stralsund.</p>
        <p>铁雷与华伦斯坦两人率领哈布斯堡军队攻下德意志的新教徒的疆土，直达波罗的海沿岸。新教徒的丹麦王与旧教徒为邻，危险极大。基利斯当第四为自卫起见，便乘他敌人未到太强时候，出兵进攻。丹麦的军队开入德意志，失败了。华伦斯坦战胜之后，声势浩大，丹麦不能不休战求和。只有一个波罗的海的都市还在新教徒手里。那就是斯脱莱逊。</p>

        <p>THE THIRTY YEARS WAR（三十年战争）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>There, in the early summer of the year 1630, landed King Gustavus Adolphus of the house of Vasa, king of Sweden, and famous as the man who had defended his country against the Russians. A Protestant prince of unlimited ambition, desirous of making Sweden the centre of a great Northern Empire, Gustavus Adolphus was welcomed by the Protestant princes of Europe as the saviour of the Lutheran cause. He defeated Tilly, who had just successfully butchered the Protestant inhabitants of Magdeburg. Then his troops began their great march through the heart of Germany in an attempt to reach the Habsburg possessions in Italy. Threatened in the rear by the Catholics, Gustavus suddenly veered around and defeated the main Habsburg army in the battle of Lützen. Unfortunately the Swedish king was killed when he strayed away from his troops. But the Habsburg power had been broken.</p>
        <p>一六三○年孟夏，以击退俄罗斯保全他的国家著名的瑞典王华刹王室的考斯道夫·阿多夫在那里登岸。他是一个野心极大的新教徒，希望将瑞典作为北方大帝国的中心，欧洲新教徒的君主们欢迎他为路德派的救主。他打败了刚刚杀尽曼格得堡的新教徒的铁雷。于是他的军队穿过德意志的腹地，想要深入哈布斯堡在意大利的领土。因为后方有旧教徒的威吓，考斯道夫突然改变方向，在旅琛一役，打败了哈布斯堡的主要军队。不幸这位瑞典国王与他的军队失散了，并且被杀身死。但是哈布斯堡的势力却被摧折了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Ferdinand, who was a suspicious sort of person, at once began to distrust his own servants. Wallenstein, his commander-in-chief, was murdered at his instigation. When the Catholic Bourbons, who ruled France and hated their Habsburg rivals, heard of this, they joined the Protestant Swedes. The armies of Louis XIII invaded the eastern part of Germany, and Turenne and Condé added their fame to that of Baner and Weimar, the Swedish generals, by murdering, pillaging and burning Habsburg property. This brought great fame and riches to the Swedes and caused the Danes to become envious. The Protestant Danes thereupon declared war upon the Protestant Swedes who were the allies of the Catholic French, whose political leader, the Cardinal de Richelieu, had just deprived the Huguenots(or French Protestants) of those rights of public worship which the Edict of Nantes of the year 1598 had guaranteed them.</p>
        <p>腓地南生性多疑，不久他便疑忌他的近臣。他的总司令华伦斯坦是他主使人去暗杀的。治理法兰西的旧教徒的布尔朋王室深恨他们的哈布斯堡劲敌。他们一听到华伦斯坦被刺的消息，便赶快去联络新教徒的瑞典。路易第十三的军队便进攻德意志东部。法国的土兰与孔台两将军以杀戮、劫掠、焚烧哈布斯堡的财产而与罢纳和威马两位瑞典将军齐名。瑞典人因此增加不少的荣誉与财富，引起了丹麦人的嫉妒。新教徒的丹麦人乃与新教徒的瑞典人宣战。瑞典人虽是新教徒，但与旧教徒的法兰西人联盟，而法国的政治领袖黎塞留又刚刚剥夺胡格诺派（法兰西的新教徒），在一五九八年得过《南特敕令》的保证的宗教自由权。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The war, after the habit of such encounters, did not decide anything, when it came to an end with the treaty of Westphalia in 1648. The Catholic powers remained Catholic and the Protestant powers stayed faithful to the doctrines of Luther and Calvin and Zwingli. The Swiss and Dutch Protestants were recognised as independent republics. France kept the cities of Metz and Toul and Verdun and a part of the Alsace. The Holy Roman Empire continued to exist as a sort of scare-crow state, without men, without money, without hope and without courage.</p>
        <p>这个战争，也与向来的战争一样，在一六四八年威斯特法利亚和议结束时，并没有决定什么。旧教的国家依然信仰旧教，新教的国家依然信仰路德、喀尔文、萨文黎诸派的教义。只有瑞士与荷兰的新教徒被认为独立的共和国。麦支、土耳、佛尔登与亚尔萨斯的一部分都归法兰西。至于神圣罗马帝国仍然维持它的空架子，没有人，没有钱，没有希望，也没有勇气。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The only good the Thirty Years War accomplished was a negative one. It discouraged both Catholics and Protestants from ever trying it again. Henceforth they left each other in peace. This however did not mean that religious feeling and theological hatred had been removed from this earth. On the contrary. The quarrels between Catholic and Protestant came to an end, but the disputes between the different Protestant sects continued as bitterly as ever before. In Holland a difference of opinion as to the true nature of predestination (a very obscure point of theology, but exceedingly important the eyes of your great-grandfather) caused a quarrel which ended with the decapitation of John of Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch statesman, who had been responsible for the success of the Republic during the first twenty years of its independence, and who was the great organising genius of her Indian trading company. In England, the feud led to civil war.</p>
        <p>三十年战争所成就的唯一好处是一个消极的。新教徒与旧教徒从此没有勇气再试了。他们从此相安无事了。这不是说这世界上已经没有宗教的感情与神学的仇恨。实际正是相反。旧教徒与新教徒的冲突虽然告终，但是新教徒各派间的纷争仍如从前一样激烈。在荷兰，因为对于定运命的真性质（这是神学上极隐晦的一点，但是在你的曾祖父的眼里看来是很重要的）意见的不同发生了冲突，结果是荷兰的政治家奥尔登罢奈樊耳脱的约翰的枭首。这人曾有功于荷兰独立最初二十年间共和的成功，他又是组织荷兰东印度贸易公司的伟人。在英国，宗教的纷争也引起了内乱。</p>

        <p>But before I tell you of this outbreak which led to the first execution by process-of-law of a European king, I ought to say something about the previous history of England. In this book I am trying to give you only those events of the past which can throw a light upon the conditions of the present world. If I do not mention certain countries, the cause is not to be found in any secret dislike on my part. I wish that I could tell you what happened to Norway and Switzerland and Serbia and China. But these lands exercised no great influence upon the development of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I therefore pass them by with a polite and very respectful bow. England however is in a different position. What the people of that small island have done during the last five hundred years has shaped the course of history in every corner of the world. Without a proper knowledge of the background of English history, you cannot understand what you read in the newspapers. And it is therefore necessary that you know how England happened to develop a parliamentary form of government while the rest of the European continent was still ruled by absolute monarchs.</p>
        <p>在我告诉你第一次按法律手续处决一位欧洲的君主的故事之前，我应该说说英国以前的历史。我在这书里仅仅设法告诉你那些可以说明现代情形的过去事实。我所以不提某某几个国家，并不是因为我对它们有什么私人的厌恶。我愿意告诉你们挪威、瑞士、塞尔比亚以及中国的历史如何。但是这些地方在十六与十七两世纪时，对于欧洲的发展没有多大影响。因此我很有礼的极恭敬的鞠一躬走开了。至于英国是在一个不同的地位。在那个小岛上的人民最近五百年来所做的事情形成了世界上各处历史的程序。假使你对于英国历史的背景没有相当的知识，你每天在新闻纸上所读的东西便都不会明白。所以你必须知道何以欧洲大陆各国尚受专制君主统治的时候，英国已发展一个国会政体。</p>
