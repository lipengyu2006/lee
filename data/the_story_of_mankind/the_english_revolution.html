        <p>HOW THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE “DIVINE RIGHT” OF KINGS AND THE LESS DIVINE BUT MORE REASONABLE “RIGHT OF PARLIAMENT” ENDED DISASTROUSLY FOR KING CHARLES II</p>
        <p>国王的“神圣权利”与不大神圣的但更合理的“国会权利”之间的冲突结果如何使英王查尔斯第一大遭殃</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>CÆSAR, the earliest explorer of north-western Europe, had crossed the Channel in the year 55 B.C. and had conquered England. During four centuries the country then remained a Roman province. But when the Barbarians began to threaten Rome, the garrisons were called back from the frontier that they might defend the home country and Britannia was left without a government and without protection.</p>
        <p>那位最早在欧洲西北部探险的恺撒在纪元前五十五年渡过海峡，征服了英国。从此英国做了四百年的罗马的属地。但至野蛮人开始威胁罗马，边疆的驻屯军都被调回去防卫本国时，不列颠便成了一个无政府无保护的地方。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>As soon as this became known among the hungry Saxon tribes of northern Germany, they sailed across the North Sea and made themselves at home in the prosperous island. They founded a number of independent Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (so called after the original Angles or English and the Saxon invaders) but these small states were for ever quarrelling with each other and no King was strong enough to establish himself as the head of a united country. For more than five hundred years, Mercia and Northumbria and Wessex and Sussex and Kent and East Anglia, or whatever their names, were exposed to attacks from various Scandinavian pirates. Finally in the eleventh century, England, together with Norway and northern Germany became part of the large Danish Empire of Canute the Great and the last vestiges of independence disappeared.</p>
        <p>这个消息一传到日耳曼北部的饕餮的萨克森部落，他们便驶过北海，在这繁盛的岛上自由自在的住下了。他们建设了几个独立的盎格罗·萨克森王国（这是依据最初侵入的盎格罗人或英格兰人与萨克森人称呼的）。但是这些小国永远互相攻击，并且没有一个国王足以做一个统一国家的领袖。麦细亚①、诺森伯兰、威山克斯②、肯脱③与东盎格利亚④，以及其他国家受着各色各样的斯堪的纳维亚海盗的攻击约有五百年之久。后来在十一世纪时，英格兰、挪威与北德都成了大克奴脱的丹麦大帝国的一部分，于是最后一点独立的痕迹也都消灭了。</p>

        <p>THE ENGLISH NATION（英国民族）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The Danes, in the course of time, were driven away but no sooner was England free, than it was conquered for the fourth time. The new enemies were the descendants of another tribe of Norsemen who early in the tenth century had invaded France and had founded the Duchy of Normandy. William, Duke of Normandy, who for a long time had looked across the water with an envious eye, crossed the Channel in October of the year 1066. At the battle of Hastings, on October the fourteenth of that year, he destroyed the weak forces of Harold of Wessex, the last of the Anglo-Saxon Kings and established himself as King of England. But neither William nor his successors of the House of Anjou and Plantagenet regarded England as their true home. To them the island was merely a part of their great inheritance on the continent—a sort of colony inhabited by rather backward people upon whom they forced their own language and civilisation. Gradually however the “colony” of England gained upon the“Mother country” of Normandy. At the same time the Kings of France were trying desperately to get rid of the powerful Norman-English neighbours who were in truth no more than disobedient servants of the French crown. After a century of war fare the French people, under the leadership of a young girl by the name of Joan of Arc, drove the “foreigners”from their soil. Joan herself, taken a prisoner at the battle of Compiègne in the year 1430 and sold by her Burgundian captors to the English soldiers, was burned as a witch. But the English never gained foothold upon the continent and their Kings were at last able to devote all their time to their British possessions. As the feudal nobility of the island had been engaged in one of those strange feuds which were as common in the middle ages as measles and small-pox, and as the greater part of the old landed proprietors had been killed during these so-called Wars of the Roses, it was quite easy for the Kings to increase their royal power. And by the end of the fifteenth century, England was a strongly centralised country, ruled by Henry VII of the House of Tudor, whose famous Court of Justice, the “Star Chamber” of terrible memory, suppressed all attempts on the part of the surviving nobles to regain their old influence upon the government of the country with the utmost severity.</p>
        <p>经过相当的时期，丹麦人即被逐出境外，但是英国得到自由不久，又受第四次的征服。这次的新敌人就是远在第十世纪时进攻法兰西，而建立诺曼底公国的另一诺斯人部落的后裔。在隔岸垂涎许久的诺曼底的威廉公于一○六六年的十月渡过海峡来。那年的十月十四日在海斯丁一役，威廉消灭了最末的盎格罗·萨克森王威山克斯的海洛特的单薄军队，自立为英国国王。但无论威廉或他的安茹与不兰他日奈⑤王室的承继者，都不承认英格兰为他们的本土。他们只以它为他们在欧洲大陆上的一部分遗产——一种知识比较落后的人所居的殖民地，他们强使这些人采用他们的言语与文明。但是渐渐的这个英格兰殖民地压服了诺曼底的“祖国”。同时法兰西国王竭力设法摆脱他们的诺曼英格兰强邻，因为这时诺曼英格兰实在已是法兰西王的倔强的仆役了。经过百年的战争，法兰西人在一位少女名约安·达克的领袖之下，把这些“异邦人”从他们的地上逐出去。佐安自己于一四三○年刚必尼⑥的一役，被葡尔根第人擒获，卖给英国兵，当作女巫烧死了。但英国人从来没有在大陆上得到立足地，因此他们的国王可以用全副精神致力于他们的属地。这时岛上的封建诸侯们正从事于一种在中世纪时像疹子、天花一样流行的奇怪的斗争。因为大部分的老地主都在几次“玫瑰战争”中死去了，所以做国王的很容易扩张他们的君权。到了十五世纪之末，英格兰已成一个权力绝对集中的国家，受治于都铎王室的亨利第七，他的有名的可怕的“星院法庭”，用极严厉的手段压服那些残存的贵族们，不让他们再想恢复他们对于政府的势力。</p>

        <p>THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR（百年战争）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>In the year 1509 Henry VII was succeeded by his son Henry VIII, and from that moment on the history of England gained a new importance for the country ceased to be a mediæval island and became a modern state.</p>
        <p>一五○九年，亨利第七的王位传授给他的儿子亨利第八。从那时起英格兰的历史获得一个新的重要，因为这个国家已经不是一个中世纪的岛屿，而成为近代的国家了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Henry had no deep interest in religion. He gladly used a private disagreement with the Pope about one of his many divorces to declare himself independent of Rome and make the church of England the first of those “nationalistic churches” in which the worldly ruler also acts as the spiritual head of his subjects. This peaceful reformation of 1034 not only gave the house of Tudor the support of the English clergy, who for a long time had been exposed to the violent attacks of many Lutheran propagandists, but it also increased the Royal power through the confiscation of the former possessions of the monasteries. At the same time it made Henry popular with the merchants and tradespeople, who as the proud and prosperous inhabitants of an island which was separated from the rest of Europe by a wide and deep channel, had a great dislike for everything “foreign” and did not want an Italian bishop to rule their honest British souls.</p>
        <p>亨利对于宗教没有多大兴趣。他因为一次离婚与教皇发生了意见，他很高兴利用这点意见，宣告脱离罗马，将英格兰教会造成第一个“国民的教会”，在这教会里，世俗的治者也就是人民精神界的领袖。这个一五三四年的和平革命，不但使都铎王室获得英国僧侣的拥护（他们受了许多路德派宣传者的猛烈攻击已久），又因为没收寺院以前所有的财产，增加了国王的权力。同时使亨利第八更受商人的欢迎。这些商人乃是骄矜殷富的岛民，因为他们的岛与其他的欧洲地方隔着一个宽而且深的海峡，所以对于任何外国东西非常不欢喜，且也不愿让一个意大利僧正来治理他们忠实的不列颠灵魂。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>In 1547 Henry died. He left the throne to his small son, aged ten. The guardians of the child, favoring the modern Lutheran doctrines, did their best to help the cause of Protestantism. But the boy died before he was sixteen, and was succeeded by his sister Mary, the wife of Philip II of Spain, who burned the bishops of the new “national church” and in other ways followed the example of her royal Spanish husband.</p>
        <p>一五四七年亨利第八逝世，将王位传给他的十岁的小儿。这个孩子的保护人因为偏袒路德教旨，竭力帮助新教。但这国王不到十六岁便死了。承继王位的是他的姊姊，西班牙的腓力第二的王后马利。她烧死新“国教”的僧正，其他事务都是依着她西班牙的丈夫的办法。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Fortunately she died, in the year 1558, and was succeeded by Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, the second of his six wives, whom he had decapitated when she no longer pleased him. Elizabeth, who had spent some time in prison, and who had been released only at the request of the Holy Roman Emperor, was a most cordial enemy of everything Catholic and Spanish. She shared her father’s indifference in the matter of religion but she inherited his ability as a very shrewd judge of character, and spent the forty-five years of her reign in strengthening the power of the dynasty and in increasing the revenue and possessions of her merry islands. In this she was most ably assisted by a number of men who gathered around her throne and made the Elizabethan age a period of such importance that you ought to study it in detail in one of the special books of which I shall tell you in the bibliography at the end of this volume.</p>
        <p>幸而她在一五五八年逝世。由亨利第八与他六位王妃中的第二位安·波伦⑦（这位王妃失宠时，亨利把她枭首）所生的女儿依利萨伯继位。这位曾在狱中住过些时，只因神圣罗马皇帝的请求而被释放的依利萨伯对于加特力教与西班牙的一切事物都极端反对。她对宗教的冷淡，与她父亲一样，她也承受了她父亲那种识人的锐敏本领。她在位四十五年，巩固了朝廷的势力，增加了她的快乐的岛国的领土与收入。这是因为她有许多能干的朝臣的辅佐，使依利萨伯的时代成为英国史上一个极重要的时代。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Elizabeth, however, did not feel entirely safe upon her throne. She had a rival and a very dangerous one. Mary, of the house of Stuart, daughter of a French duchess and a Scottish father, widow of king Francis II of France and daughter-in-law of Catherine of Medici (who had organised the murders of Saint Bartholomew’s night), was the mother of a little boy who was afterwards to become the first Stuart king of England. She was an ardent Catholic and a willing friend to those who were the enemies of Elizabeth. Her own lack of political ability and the violent methods which she employed to punish her Calvinistic subjects, caused a revolution in Scotland and forced Mary to take refuge on English territory. For eighteen years she remained in England, plotting forever and a day against the woman who had given her shelter and who was at last obliged to follow the advice of her trusted councilors “to cutte off the Scottish Queen’s heade.”</p>
        <p>虽然如此，依利萨伯总觉得她的王位不甚稳固。她有一个对敌，并且是很危险的一个。斯图亚特王室的马利是一位法兰西女公爵与一位苏格兰父亲所生的女儿，是法王法朗西第二的寡妇梅第基家的加塞林⑧的儿媳（她曾组织圣巴多罗买节夜的大屠戮），是那个后来成为英国斯图亚特王室第一位君主的孩子的母亲。她是一个热心的旧教徒，凡是依利萨伯的仇敌都是她愿意结交的朋友。因为她自己的政治才能的缺乏与她对于喀尔文派的臣民所采取的暴烈方法，结果引起了苏格兰革命，她不得不逃亡英国。她在英国住了十八年，但她时时对于那个庇护她的女人图谋不轨。结果这女人不得不听她所信任的顾问的忠告“切去苏格兰王后的首级”。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The head was duly “cutte off” in the year 1587 and caused a war with Spain. But the combined navies of England and Holland defeated Philip’s Invincible Armada, as we have already seen, and the blow which had been meant to destroy the power of the two great anti-Catholic leaders was turned into a profitable business adventure.</p>
        <p>那首级遂于一五八七年“切去”，这事引起了对西班牙的一场战争。正如我们已经知道的英、荷的联合海军把腓力的“无敌大舰队”打败了。这一击，原为消灭两个反对旧教的大首领的势力的，后来反变成为一个营商获利的冒险。</p>

        <p>JOHN AND SEBASTIAN CABOT SEE THE COAST OF NEWFOUNDLAND（约翰与萨拔斯丁喀波脱看见纽芬兰海岸）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>For now at last, after many years of hesitation, the English as well as the Dutch thought it their good right to invade the Indies and America and avenge the ills which their Protestant brethren had suffered at the hands of the Spaniards. The English had been among the earliest successors of Columbus. British ships, commanded by the Venetian pilot Giovanni Caboto (or Cabot), had been the first to discover and explore the northern American continent in 1496. Labrador and Newfoundland were of little importance as a possible colony. But the banks of Newfoundland offered a rich reward to the English fishing fleet. A year later, in 1497, the same Cabot had explored the coast of Florida.</p>
        <p>直到如今，经过多少年的踌躇，英国人与荷兰人才觉得他们应该进攻印度和美洲，报复他们新教的同胞们在西班牙人手中所受的祸害。英国人也是最早继续哥伦布的事业的民族。一个威尼斯的领港佐凡呢·喀波脱⑨，率领英国船只在一四九六年首先发见，并探察了北美大陆。拉布拉多与纽芬兰作殖民地虽不重要，但纽芬兰的海岸却给了英国渔船极厚的报酬。一年以后，即一四九七年，喀波脱又探险了佛罗里达海岸。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Then had come the busy years of Henry VII and Henry VIII when there had been no money for foreign explorations. But under Elizabeth, with the country at peace and Mary Stuart in prison, the sailors could leave their harbour without fear for the fate of those whom they left behind. While Elizabeth was still a child, Willoughby had ventured to sail past the North Cape and one of his captains, Richard Chancellor, pushing further eastward in his quest of a possible road to the Indies, had reached Archangel, Russia, where he had established diplomatic and commercial relations with the mysterious rulers of this distant Muscovite Empire. During the first years of Elizabeth’s rule this voyage had been followed up by many others. Merchant adventurers, working for the benefit of a “joint stock Company” had laid the foundations of trading companies which in later centuries were to become colonies. Half pirate, half diplomat, willing to stake everything on a single lucky voyage, smugglers of everything that could be loaded into the hold of a vessel, dealers in men and merchandise with equal indifference to everything except their profit, the sailors of Elizabeth had carried the English flag and the fame of their Virgin Queen to the four corners of the Seven Seas. Meanwhile William Shakespeare kept her Majesty amused at home, and the best brains and the best wit of England co-operated with the queen in her attempt to change the feudal inheritance of Henry VIII into a modern national state.</p>
        <p>及至到了亨利第七与亨利第八的多事的时代，没有经费作海外的探险。但在依利萨伯时代，国家泰平，马利·斯图亚特被禁锢在监狱里，水手们出发可以不必为那些留在家里的人的运命担忧。当依利萨伯幼年的时候，韦罗贝⑩曾冒险经过北岬；他的一个船长理查谦色勒向东进行，为要寻觅通印度的路，到了俄罗斯的亚尔干日尔，他在那里同那个遥远的莫斯科帝国的神秘的君王成立了外交与商业的关系。依利萨伯在位的初年，许多别的航海家继续了这个航行。那些冒险的商人为谋合股公司的利益，设立许多贸易公司的基础，后来这些基础都成为殖民地。依利萨伯时代的水手们，一半是海盗性质，一半是外交官性质，愿意为一次侥幸的航行牺牲一切；尽量的偷运凡是一只船里容得下的各种东西；贩卖人口又贩卖货品，除去获利之外，他们什么都不注意，他们把英国的国旗与女王的声名传布到四方。同时国内尚有莎士比亚给女王消遣，而英国最有才智最有脑筋的人，又与女王共同计划如何将亨利第八的封建遗产改变成为现代的民族国家。</p>

        <p>THE ELIZABETHAN STAGE（依利萨伯时代的戏台）</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>In the year 1603 the old lady died at the age of seventy. Her cousin, the great-grandson of her own grandfather Henry VII and son of Mary Stuart, her rival and enemy, succeeded her as James I. By the Grace of God, he found himself the ruler of a country which had escaped the fate of its continental rivals. While the European Protestants and Catholics were killing each other in a hopeless attempt to break the power of their adversaries and establish the exclusive rule of their own particular creed, England was at peace and “reformed” at leisure without going to the extremes of either Luther or Loyola. It gave the island kingdom an enormous advantage in the coming struggle for colonial possessions. It assured England a leadership in international affairs which that country has maintained until the present day. Not even the disastrous adventure with the Stuarts was able to stop this normal development.</p>
        <p>一六○三年，这位老太太七十岁去世了。她的侄子，她祖父亨利第七的曾孙，她的劲敌马利·斯图亚特的儿子，继立为惹米斯第一。他蒙上帝的恩惠，他的国家不与它大陆的劲敌同运命。当欧洲的新旧教徒枉然拼命破坏敌人的势力以图建立自己信仰所独有的统治而互相残杀的时候，英国则很平安，不必趋于极端去服从路德或罗耀拉，自由自在的从事于它的“改革”。这个使英国后来在殖民地竞争上占到莫大的便宜。且又确保英国为国际政治的领袖，这个地位至今仍然不变。虽然在斯图亚特时代有不幸的事变，也不能阻止这种正当的发展。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The Stuarts, who succeeded the Tudors, were “foreigners” in England. They do not seem to have appreciated or understood this fact. The native house of Tudor could steal a horse, but the “foreign” Stuarts were not allowed to look at the bridle without causing great popular disapproval. Old Queen Bess had ruled her domains very much as she pleased. In general however, she had always followed a policy which meant money in the pocket of the honest (and otherwise) British merchants. Hence the Queen had been always assured of the wholehearted support of her grateful people. And small liberties taken with some of the rights and prerogatives of Parliament were gladly overlooked for the ulterior benefits which were derived from her Majesty’s strong and successful foreign policies.</p>
        <p>承继都铎的斯图亚特王室在英国算是“异邦人”。他们似乎并不看重或理会这个事实。本国的都铎王室不妨偷一匹马，而外国的斯图亚特王室连望一望马鞍子都会惹起人民的反对。老依利萨伯王后愿意怎样治理她的疆土都可以。虽然如此，在大体上，她的政策永远使诚实的（以及不诚实的）英国商人可以获利。因此这位女王永远受感激她的人民的全心爱戴。人民因为女王陛下强硬的成功的外交政策所得到的利益，也就容让她侵占国会的权利与特权的那些小小的自由了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Outwardly King James continued the same policy. But he lacked that personal enthusiasm which had been so very typical of his great predecessor. Foreign commerce continued to be encouraged. The Catholics were not granted any liberties. But when Spain smiled pleasantly upon England in an effort to establish peaceful relations, James was seen to smile back. The majority of the English people did not like this, but James was their King and they kept quiet.</p>
        <p>在表面上，惹米斯第一仍然继续同样的政策。但他缺乏他的著名前任所有的热诚。国外的贸易继续奖励。旧教徒不准有任何自由。但当西班牙笑脸向英格兰竭力要求和平的时候，惹米斯也报之以笑脸。大多数的英国人民都不喜欢这种办法，但惹米斯是他们的国王，他们只好不说话。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Soon there were other causes of friction. King James and his son, Charles I, who succeeded him in the year 1625 both firmly believed in the principle of their “divine right” to administer their realm as they thought fit without consulting the wishes of their subjects. The idea was not new. The Popes, who in more than one way had been the successors of the Roman Emperors (or rather of the Roman Imperial ideal of a single and undivided state covering the entire known world), had always regarded themselves and had been publicly recognised as the “Vice-Regents of Christ upon Earth.”No one questioned the right of God to rule the world as He saw fit. As a natural result, few ventured to doubt the right of the divine “Vice-Regent”to do the same thing and to demand the obedience of the masses because he was the direct representative of the Absolute Ruler of the Universe and responsible only to Almighty God.</p>
        <p>不久又发生了别的冲突。惹米斯王与他儿子查尔斯第一（一六二五年承继他的王位的）都确信他们有神圣权利，可以任意治理他们的国家，不必征求人民的意见。这种观念不是新的。在许多方面都算是罗马皇帝的承继者（或者应该说是承继罗马帝国惟一的不能分离的全世界的国家理想）的教皇向来自己承认，也被公然承认为“基督的世上的代理者”。上帝按着他认为适当的治理世界，无人敢责问的。这个自然的结果，就是这位神圣的代理者若是也做同样的事情与要求人民的服从，便也很少有人敢怀疑他的权力了，因为他是宇宙间唯一的主宰的直接的代表，只对全能的上帝负责任。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>When the Lutheran Reformation proved successful, those rights which formerly had been invested in the Papacy were taken over by the many European sovereigns who became Protestants. As head of their own national or dynastic churches they insisted upon being “Christ’s Vice-Regents” within the limit of their own territory. The people did not question the right of their rulers to take such a step. They accepted it, just as we in our own day accept the idea of a representative system which to us seems the only reasonable and just form of government. It is unfair therefore to state that either Lutheranism or Calvinism caused the particular feeling of irritation which greeted King-James’s oft and loudly repeated assertion of his “Divine Right.”There must have been other grounds for the genuine English disbelief in the Divine Right of Kings.</p>
        <p>等到路德的宗教改革成功之后，从前赋与教皇的那些权力都被许多新教徒的欧洲君主攫夺了。他们既是国教的领袖，便坚执要求至少在他们自己的版图之内，他们是“基督的代理者”。人民对于他们的君主所进的这一步并不过问。他们接受这一点，就像我们今日接受代议制的观念一样，因为我们以为这是最合理、最公正的政体。由此看来，若说对于惹米斯屡次高声主张他的“神圣的权力”所产生的厌恶，全是路德派或喀尔文派的影响那就不公平了。英国人之真正不信国王有神圣权力，必有其他的原因。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The first positive denial of the “Divine Right” of sovereigns had been heard in the Netherlands when the Estates General abjured their lawful sovereign King Philip II of Spain, in the year 1581. “The King,” so they said, “has broken his contract and the King therefore is dismissed like any other unfaithful servant.” Since then, this particular idea of a king’s responsibilities towards his subjects had spread among many of the nations who inhabited the shores of the North Sea. They were in a very favourable position. They were rich. The poor people in the heart of central Europe, at the mercy of their Ruler’s body-guard, could not afford to discuss a problem which would at once land them in the deepest dungeon of the nearest castle. But the merchants of Holland and England who possessed the capital necessary for the maintenance of great armies and navies, who knew how to handle the almighty weapon called “credit,” had no such fear. They were willing to pit the “Divine Right” of their own good money against the “Divine Right” of any Habsburg or Bourbon or Stuart. They knew that their guilders and shillings could beat the clumsy feudal armies which were the only weapons of the King. They dared to act, where others were condemned to suffer in silence or run the risk of the scaffold.</p>
        <p>当一五八一年荷兰会议弃绝他们的合法君主西班牙的腓力第二时，第一次积极否认国王的神权的呼声是在荷兰。他们说：“国王已经破坏他的契约，因此他像其他不忠实的仆人一样的须被解职。”从此以后，国王对于人民负责任的那种特别观念传遍了北海沿岸的多数国家。他们是在一个很好的地位。他们很有钱。欧洲中部的可怜人民，凡事都须听命于他们的王家卫队，若是私自讨论一个问题，立刻就会被关在附近城堡的最深的土牢里。但是荷英两国的商人，握有维持大的海陆军所必需的资本，他们知道如何运用那所谓“信用”的全能武器，就不会有这种怕惧。他们愿以他们的金钱的“神权”与任何哈布斯堡、布尔朋或斯图亚特王室的“神权”相抗衡。他们知道他们的银币可以打倒国王的唯一武器——拙笨的封建军队。只有他们是敢作敢为的，别的人民不是忍气吞声，便是去冒断头的危险。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>When the Stuarts began to annoy the people of England with their claim that they had a right to do what they pleased and never mind the responsibility, the English middle classes used the House of Commons as their first line of defence against this abuse of the Royal Power. The Crown refused to give in and the King sent Parliament about its own business. Eleven long years, Charles I ruled alone. He levied taxes which most people regarded as illegal and he managed his British kingdom as if it had been his own country estate. He had capable assistants and we must say that he had the courage of his convictions.</p>
        <p>等到斯图亚特王室开始要求国王有权可以任意行动，不必计较责任而惹怒了英国人民，英国的中等阶级便以下议院作抵抗王权滥用的第一道防线。国王不肯屈服，竟将国会解散。查尔斯第一独自秉政者共有十一年之久。他征收大多数人民认为不合法的租税，他治理不列颠王国一如他自己的田庄一样。他有能干的人帮助他，我们必须承认，他对于他的信心是有勇气的。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Unfortunately, instead of assuring himself of the support of his faithful Scottish subjects, Charles became involved in a quarrel with the Scotch Presbyterians. Much against his will, but forced by his need for ready cash, Charles was at last obliged to call Parliament together once more. It met in April of 1640 and showed an ugly temper. It was dissolved a few weeks later. A new Parliament convened in November. This one was even less pliable than the first one. The members understood that the question of “Government by Divine Right” or “Government by Parliament” must be fought out for good and all. They attacked the King in his chief councillors and executed half a dozen of them. They announced that they would not allow themselves to be dissolved without their own approval. Finally on December 1, 1641, they presented to the King a “Grand Remonstrance” which gave a detailed account of the many grievances of the people against their Ruler.</p>
        <p>不幸查尔斯不去求助他的忠实的苏格兰人民，反而加入苏格兰的长老会徒的冲突。实在不是查尔斯的本愿，但是迫于现款的极需，终究不得不再召集国会。这次是在一六四○年四月开会，显示很坏的态度。不到几个星期，这个国会又被解散。在十一月又召集一个新国会。这一次比上一次更不柔顺。议员们都明白“神圣统治的政府”与“国会统治的政府”的问题应该作一个彻底的解决。他们攻击国王的主要参议，作为攻击国王，并且杀死了六个参议。他们宣言不得他们的同意，他们不能被解散。结果在一六四一年十二月一日，他们递给国王一个“大罪状”详述人民对于国王的许多不平。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Charles, hoping to derive some support for his own policy in the country districts, left London in January of 1642. Each side organised an army and prepared for open warfare between the absolute power of the crown and the absolute power of Parliament. During this struggle, the most powerful religious element of England, called the Puritans, (they were Anglicans who had tried to purify their doctrines to the most absolute limits), came quickly to the front. The regiments of “Godly men,” commanded by Oliver Cromwell, with their iron discipline and their profound confidence in the holiness of their aims, soon became the model for the entire army of the opposition. Twice Charles was defeated. After the battle of Naseby, in 1645, he fled to Scotland. The Scotch sold him to the English.</p>
        <p>查尔斯希望他的政策从乡村方面可以得些帮助，遂于一六四一年正月离开伦敦。国王与国会双方都组织军队，准备作国王的绝对权力与国会的绝对权力的公然决斗。在这次冲突之间，英国最有势力的宗教分子称为清教徒的（他们是安立甘会，想要极端澄清他们的教旨）赶快来到前方。奥力弗·克伦威尔率领的“虔诚人”的军队，因为纪律严明，对于他们宗旨的神圣有深的信仰，不久便做了全军的模范。查尔斯两次都战败了。一六四五年在纳斯卑一战之后，他便逃奔苏格兰，苏格兰人将他卖给了英国人。</p>

        <p>There followed a period of intrigue and an uprising of the Scotch Presbyterians against the English Puritan. In August of the year 1648 after the three-days’ battle of Preston Pans, Cromwell made an end to this second civil war, and took Edinburgh. Meanwhile his soldiers, tired of further talk and wasted hours of religious debate, had decided to act on their own initiative. They removed from Parliament all those who did not agree with their own Puritan views. Thereupon the “Rump,” which was what was left of the old Parliament, accused the King of high treason. The House of Lords refused to sit as a tribunal. A special tribunal was appointed and it condemned the King to death. On the 30th of January of the year 1649, King Charles walked quietly out of a window of White Hall onto the scaffold. That day, the Sovereign People, acting through their chosen representatives, for the first time executed a ruler who had failed to understand his own position in the modern state.</p>
        <p>以后就是一个苏格兰的长老会徒反对英格兰的清教徒的阴谋与叛乱的时代。一六四八年的八月，在普雷斯顿潘斯连战三天之后，克伦威尔结束了这二次的内战，占领了爱丁堡。那时克伦威尔的军士不愿对于宗教的纷争再费唇舌与时间，决定按他们自己的主义做去。他们把所有与清教徒意见不合的人，一齐逐出国会。于是由旧国会遗留的残余国会（Rump）斥国王为国事犯。但贵族院不肯居于审判的地位。于是另委一个审判法庭，定国王死罪。一六四九年的正月三十日，查尔斯王很安详的从槐忒好尔的窗子出来，走上断头台。那一天乃是有主权的人民假手于他们所选的代表，第一次处决一位不明白自己在现代国家的地位的元首。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The period which followed the death of Charles is usually called after Oliver Cromwell. At first the unofficial Dictator of England, he was officially made Lord Protector in the year 1653. He ruled five years. He used this period to continue the policies of Elizabeth. Spain once more became the arch enemy of England and war upon the Spaniard was made a national and sacred issue.</p>
        <p>查尔斯死后的时代，普通称为奥力弗·克伦威尔时代。起初他是英国的非正式的迭克推多，他被正式举为护国者（Lord Protector），是在一六五三年。他治理了五年。他利用这个时代继续依利萨伯的政策。所以西班牙又成了英格兰的大仇敌，对西班牙的战争，便成了国家的神圣问题。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>The commerce of England and the interests of the traders were placed before everything else, and the Protestant creed of the strictest nature was rigourously maintained. In maintaining England’s position abroad, Cromwell was successful. As a social reformer, however, he failed very badly. The world is made up of a number of people and they rarely think alike. In the long run, this seems a very wise provision. A government of and by and for one single part of the entire community cannot possibly survive. The Puritans had been a great force for good when they tried to correct the abuse of the royal power. As the absolute Rulers of England they became intolerable.</p>
        <p>在英国，商业与商人的利益比什么都重要。性质严格的新教徒的信仰很严厉的维持着。克伦威尔维持英国国外的地位固然成功，但做一个社会的改革家，就非常的失败。世界是由许多人组成的，各人的思想很少相同的。为长久设想，这是一个顶聪明的看法。一个只是全社会一部分人的只由一部分人主持的，只为一部分人的利益的政府是不能存在的。清教徒矫正王权的滥用，实是为善的一个大势力。但是作为英格兰的绝对的治理者，那就不成了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>When Cromwell died in 1658, it was an easy matter for the Stuarts to return to their old kingdom. Indeed, they were welcomed as “deliverers” by the people who had found the yoke of the meek Puritans quite as hard to bear as that of autocratic King Charles. Provided the Stuarts were willing to forget about the Divine Right of their late and lamented father and were willing to recognise the superiority of Parliament, the people promised that they would be loyal and faithful subjects.</p>
        <p>克伦威尔在一六五八年逝世，此时斯图亚特王室复辟便容易了。人民真的把他们视为“救主”，因为人民觉得那些温柔的清教徒的束缚与独裁的查尔斯王一样难堪。假使斯图亚特王室肯忘记他们已故的可悲悼的父亲的神权，而愿意承认国会的主权，人民也就答应做他忠实的百姓。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Two generations tried to make a success of this new arrangement. But the Stuarts apparently had not learned their lesson and were unable to drop their bad habits. Charles II, who came back in the year 1660, was an amiable but worthless person. His indolence and his constitutional insistence upon following the easiest course, together with his conspicuous success as a liar, prevented an open outbreak between himself and his people. By the act of Uniformity in 1662 he broke the power of the Puritan clergy by banishing all dissenting clergymen from their parishes. By the so-called Conventicle Act of 1664 he tried to prevent the Dissenters from attending religious meetings by a threat of deportation to the West Indies. This looked too much like the good old days of Divine Right. People began to show the old and well-known signs of impatience, and Parliament suddenly experienced difficulty in providing the King with funds.</p>
        <p>此后两代的人民都想使这个新的办法成功。但是斯图亚特王室显然没有受到教训，不能放弃他们的坏习惯。查尔斯第二在一六六○年回到英国，他是一位温文尔雅，但是毫无价值的人。他的懒惰，他的避难就易的性情，他的说谎的大本领，使他避免与他的百姓公然决裂。他借一六六二年的《宗教统一法》以逐出所有不奉国教的牧师于教区之外的办法来破坏清教牧师的势力。他又借所谓一六六四年的《秘密礼拜法》以充军到西印度的恫吓来禁止非国教徒做宗教的集会。这又太像神权时代的情景了。人民渐渐显出不耐烦的故态，国会也忽然感觉供给国王款项的困难了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Since he could not get money from an unwilling Parliament, Charles borrowed it secretly from his neighbour and cousin King Louis of France. He betrayed his Protestant allies in return for 200,000 pounds per year, and laughed at the poor simpletons of Parliament.</p>
        <p>查尔斯第二既然不能从一个不愿供给他的国会里得到款子，他便私下向他邻居，又是他的表兄弟法国的路易借钱。他以每年二十万镑的代价，卖了他的新教徒的同盟，暗地笑国会里可怜的傻子们。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Economic independence suddenly gave the King great faith in his own strength. He had spent many years of exile among his Catholic relations and he had a secret liking for their religion. Perhaps he could bring England back to Rome! He passed a Declaration of Indulgence which suspended the old laws against the Catholics and Dissenters. This happened just when Charles’ younger brother James was said to have become a Catholic. All this looked suspicious to the man in the street People began to fear some terrible Popish plot. A new spirit of unrest entered the land. Most of the people wanted to prevent another outbreak of civil war. To them Royal Oppression and a Catholic King—yea, even Divine Right, —were preferable to a new struggle between members of the same race. Others however were less lenient. They were the much-feared Dissenters, who invariably had the courage of their convictions. They were led by several great noblemen who did not want to see a return of the old days of absolute royal power.</p>
        <p>经济上的独立使国王忽然间对于自己的势力更有信仰。他在他的旧教徒的亲戚中消磨了许多亡命的岁月，因此他私下很喜欢他们的宗教。也许他有力使英国仍归罗马教！他通过了一个“放任谕告”以停止从前对于旧教徒施行的法律。这事的发生正在传说查尔斯的兄弟惹米斯归向天主教的时候，人民对此都发生怀疑。人民渐渐害怕将有什么可怕的教皇派的阴谋，一种新的不安的精神弥漫全国。大多数人想要防止二次内战发生。在他们看来，国王的压迫与一个旧教徒的国王——甚而至于神权——都胜于一个新的同族相杀。但另一部分人便没有如此宽容。这些人是极其可畏的反国教徒，对于他们的信仰永远有勇气。他们有几个贵族做他们的领袖，这些贵族都不愿看见恢复昔日绝对的王权的。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>For almost ten years, these two great parties, the Whigs (the middle class element, called by this derisive name be-cause in the year 1640 a lot of Scottish Whiggamores or horse-drovers headed by the Presbyterian clergy, had marched to Edinburgh to oppose the King) and the Tories (an epithet originally used against the Royalist Irish adherents but now applied to the supporters of the King) opposed each other, but neither wished to bring about a crisis. They allowed Charles to die peacefully in his bed and permitted the Catholic James II to succeed his brother in 1685. But when James, after threatening the country with the terrible foreign invention of a “standing army” (which was to be commanded by Catholic Frenchmen), issued a second Declaration of Indulgence in 1688, and ordered it to be read in all Anglican churches, he went just a trifle beyond that line of sensible demarcation which can only be transgressed by the most popular of rulers under very exceptional circumstances. Seven bishops refused to comply with the Royal Command. They were accused of “seditious libel.”They were brought before a court. The jury which pronounced the verdict of “not guilty” reaped a rich harvest of popular approval.</p>
        <p>辉格（民权党）与托立（王权党）两大党派相对抗几有十年之久，但谁也不愿造成危机。他们让查尔斯得了善终，让旧教徒的惹米斯第二在一六八五年承继王位。但惹米斯第二先以可怕的外国常备军（这个军队由一个法国的旧教徒将军率领）威吓国人，后在一六八八年公布二次的“放任谕告”，命令一切安立甘教会诵读这个谕告，这样的行为未免越出范围了。在寻常只有最受人民爱戴的君王，且在特别情形下，才可有这越轨的行为。七位僧正拒绝服从王的命令。他们便被控为“谋乱”之罪，被逮到法庭。但是判决他们无罪的陪审员备受大众的嘉奖。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>At this unfortunate moment, James (who in a second marriage had taken to wife Maria of the Catholic house of Modena-Este) became the father of a son. This meant that the throne was to go to a Catholic boy rather than to his older sisters, Mary and Anne, who were Protestants. The man in the street again grew suspicious. Maria of Modena was too old to have children! It was all part of a plot! A strange baby had been brought into the palace by some Jesuit priest that England might have a Catholic monarch. And so on. It looked as if another civil war would break out. Then seven well-known men, both Whigs and Tories, wrote a letter asking the husband of James’s oldest daughter Mary, William III the Stadtholder or head of the Dutch Republic, to come to England and deliver the country from its lawful but entirely undesirable sovereign.</p>
        <p>正在这个不幸的时候，惹米斯（他第二次结婚所娶的是天主教的摩登奈斯脱家的马利亚）生了一个儿子。意思就是将来他的王位是属于一个旧教的孩子，而不属于他两位新教徒的姐姐马利亚与安妮了。街头的人又在怀疑了。摩登奈家的马利亚年岁太大，不能生育的！这全是计策！这是一个陌生人的孩子，由一个耶稣会的僧侣抱进宫来的，为使英国能有一位旧教的国王。全是这一类的话。二次的内战好像又要发生了。于是辉格党与托立党中七个有声望的人写了一封信要求惹米斯的长女的丈夫荷兰共和国的首领威廉第三到英国来，将这国家从那位虽是合法，然而绝对不成的国王手中救出来。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>On the fifth of November of the year 1688, William landed at Torbay. As he did not wish to make a martyr out of his father-in-law, he helped him to escape safely to France. On the 22nd of January of 1689 he summoned Parliament. On the 13th of February of the same year he and his wife Mary were proclaimed joint sovereigns of England and the country was saved for the Protestant cause.</p>
        <p>一六八八年的十一月五日，威廉在托尔弯登岸。他不愿他的岳父殉难，所以帮助他平安逃往法国。一六八九年的正月二日，他召集国会。同年的二月十三日，他与他的妻子马利被宣布为英国的联合君主，因此新教在英国得救了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>Parliament, having undertaken to be something more than a mere advisory body to the King, made the best of its opportunities. The old Petition of Rights of the year 1628 was fished out of a forgotten nook of the archives. A second and more drastic Bill of Rights demanded that the sovereign of England should belong to the Anglican church. Furthermore it stated that the king had no right to suspend the laws or permit certain privileged citizens to disobey certain laws. It stipulated that “without consent of Parliament no taxes could be levied and no army could be maintained.” Thus in the year 1689 did England acquire an amount of liberty unknown in any other country of Europe.</p>
        <p>国会既然不但以国王的一个区区的顾问团体自居，便尽量的利用了这个机会。一六二八年的老的《权利请愿书》又从档案的已经遗忘的犄角里捞出来。二次的较前更激烈的《权利法案》要求英国国王必须属于安立甘教会。且述国王无权停止法律的效力，或允许某种有特权的市民可以不守某种法律。它又订“不得国会认可，不得征税，不得养兵”。这使英国在一六八九年获得其他欧洲各国所无的大宗自由。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>But it is not only on account of this great liberal measure that the rule of William in England is still remembered. During his lifetime, government by a “responsible” ministry first developed. No king of course can rule alone. He needs a few trusted advisors. The Tudors had their Great Council which was composed of Nobles and Clergy. This body grew too large. It was restricted to the small “Privy Council.” In the course of time it became the custom of these councillors to meet the king in a cabinet in the palace. Hence they were called the “Cabinet Council.” After a short while they were known as the “Cabinet.”</p>
        <p>但是英国威廉的政治至今未被遗忘者，并非只为这大宗的自由。威廉在世时，责任内阁的政府初次发达。当然没有一个国王可以独自行政的。必须有几个可靠的顾问。都铎尔王室有贵族与僧侣组织的大会议。这个团体扩张得太大。后来被缩成小的“枢密院”。渐渐这些议员们在宫内的小屋里与国王会见成了习惯。因此他们便被称为“内阁会议”。不久便被称为“内阁”。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>William, like most English sovereigns before him, had chosen his advisors from among all parties. But with the increased strength of Parliament, he had found it impossible to direct the politics of the country with the help of the Tories while the Whigs had a majority in the house of Commons. Therefore the Tories had been dismissed and the Cabinet Council had been composed entirely of Whigs. A few years later when the Whigs lost their power in the House of Commons, the king, for the sake of convenience, was obliged to look for his support among the leading Tories. Until his death in 1702, William was too busy fighting Louis of France to bother much about the government of England. Practically all important affairs had been left to his Cabinet Council. When William’s sister-in-law, Anne, succeeded him in 1702 this condition of affairs continued. When she died in 1714 (and unfortunately not a single one of her seventeen children survived her) the throne went to George I of the House of Hanover, the son of Sophie, grand-daughter of James I.</p>
        <p>威廉与在他以前的大多数英王一样，也从各党中选择他的顾问。但是国会的势力渐渐扩充，辉格党在下议院占多数的时候，他便不能借托立党的势力行使国家大政。于是托立党员全被开除，内阁会议全由辉格党员组织。几年之后，辉格党在下议院失势后，国王为便利起见，不得不求助于托立党的主要人物。威廉直到一七○二年逝世为止，一生忙的是与法国的路易战争，所以没有多大工夫去麻烦英国的政治。实际上一切重要的政务都由他的内阁会议办理。即在一七○二年威廉的妻妹安妮即位之后，此种情形仍继续存在。等到一七一四年安后逝世后（不幸她所生的十七个子女没有一个死在她后头），她的王位便传给汉诺弗王室的乔治第一，就是惹米斯第一的孙女莎菲的儿子。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>This somewhat rustic monarch, who never learned a word of English, was entirely lost in the complicated mazes of England’s political arrangements. He left everything to his Cabinet Council and kept away from their meetings, which bored him as he did not understand a single sentence. In this way the Cabinet got into the habit of ruling England and Scotland (whose Parliament had been joined to that of England in 1707) without bothering the King, who was apt to spend a great deal of his time on the continent.</p>
        <p>这位有些村俗一个英国字不识的国王，对于英格兰的复杂的政治组织完全茫然。他将一切事务完全交给内阁会议，自己永不到会，他连一句话都听不懂，所以便厌烦了。于是内阁渐渐养成不必麻烦国王，自己即可治理英格兰与苏格兰的习惯（苏格兰的国会在一七○七年时与英格兰的国会合并），而国王便可消磨他的大部分时间在大陆上了。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>During the reign of George I and George II, a succession of great Whigs(of whom one, Sir Robert Walpole, held office for twenty-one years) formed the Cabinet Council of the King. Their leader was finally recognised as the official leader not only of the actual Cabinet but also of the majority party in power in Parliament. The attempts of George III to take matters into his own hands and not to leave the actual business of government to his Cabinet were so disastrous that they were never repeated. And from the earliest years of the eighteenth century on, England enjoyed representative government, with a responsible ministry which conducted the affairs of the land.</p>
        <p>当乔治第一与乔治第二在位的时代，辉格党的要人（其中的罗伯·窝尔坡任职二十一年）继续组织国王的内阁会议。到后来他们的领袖不但被认为实际内阁的正式领袖，且又为国会当权的大多数党派的领袖。乔治第三想把政权独揽不交国会的企图结果非常不幸，以致此后不能再演。自从十八世纪初年起，英国采用了代议政治，有一个负责的内阁支配国家政务。</p>
      </div><div class="section">
        <p>To be quite true, this government did not represent all classes of society. Less than one man in a dozen had the right to vote. But it was the foundation for the modern representative form of government. In a quiet and orderly fashion it took the power away from the King and placed it in the hands of an ever increasing number of popular representatives. It did not bring the millenium to England, but it saved that country from most of the revolutionary outbreaks which proved so disastrous to the European continent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
        <p>实在说起来，这个政府并非代表社会的一切阶级。十二人民之中轮不到一人有投票的权利。但这是近代代议政体的基础。在一个不声不响而有秩序的形式中，渐渐将国王手里的权力，移交给人数日增不已的人民的代表们。这虽然未使英国得到千年的泰平，但使它免去在十八与十九世纪使欧洲大陆非常不幸的革命爆裂。</p>
